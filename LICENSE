I made these scripts for myself. Don't come after me if they don't work
for you. You can make them work, fork the repo or even issue a pull
request, but there is no guarantee that I will fix things. If they
work fine on my machine, they are not being changed on the master
branch unless for good reason.

With that out of the way, please feel free to use and modify these
scripts as you please. I hope they bring joy to you as they did myself
when I wrote them.
